## üéØ Quick Start

### If this is your first time:

1. **Read this file** (you are here) - 5 minutes
2. **Review the full plan**: [TERMINOLOGY-MIGRATION-PLAN.md](./TERMINOLOGY-MIGRATION-PLAN.md) - 20 minutes
3. **Complete pre-flight checklist**: [PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKLIST.md](./PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKLIST.md) - 10 minutes
4. **Get stakeholder approval** - varies
5. **Begin Phase 1** with [MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md](./MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md) - when ready

### If you're ready to execute:

1. Open [MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md](./MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md)
2. Copy **PROMPT 1** and paste into Claude Code
3. Update [MIGRATION-PROGRESS.md](./MIGRATION-PROGRESS.md) as you go

## üîç What's Changing?

### Terminology Updates

| Old Term | New Term | Context |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Founding Circle | **Founder** | User role/member type |
| Select Circle | **Referrer** or **Member** | User role/member type |
| Client | Client | ‚úÖ Unchanged |
| Candidate | Candidate | ‚úÖ Unchanged |

### Business Model Updates

**New Pricing Model:**
- Flat fees per hire (not percentage of salary)
- Tiered platform fees for companies
- Updated marketing messaging

**New Application Process:**
- Referrer application form (new)
- Founder application hidden (invite-only)

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Migration Strategy

### The Display Layer Approach

Instead of changing database values (risky), we create a **display layer** that maps old database values to new user-facing labels:

```typescript
// Database keeps old values
user.role = "founding_circle"

// Display layer shows new terminology
getRoleDisplay(user.role) // Returns: "Founder"
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Zero database risk
- ‚úÖ Instant rollback capability
- ‚úÖ Test changes safely
- ‚úÖ Gradual migration path
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to auth/permissions

---

## üìä Migration Phases

| Phase | What Happens | Risk | Time | Reversible? |
|-------|--------------|------|------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Analyze codebase impact + Create mapping layer | LOW | 2-3 hours | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Phase 2** | Update UI components | LOW | 3-4 hours | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Phase 3** | Update marketing content | LOW | 2-3 hours | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Phase 4** | Create forms, hide old forms | MED | 4-5 hours | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Phase 5** | Update all tests | LOW | 2-3 hours | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Phase 6** | Database migration | HIGH | 2-3 hours | ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium |

**Total Estimated Time:** 15-21 hours of active work across 1-2 weeks

## ‚ö° Quick Execution Guide

### Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, you MUST have:

- [ ] All tests passing (591/591)
- [ ] Clean git working tree
- [ ] Feature branch created
- [ ] Development environment working
- [ ] Stakeholder approval
- [ ] Database backup (for Phase 6 only)

### Execution Steps

**Step 1: Setup**
```bash
cd refer-ify
git checkout -b feature/terminology-migration
git status  # Should be clean
npm test    # Should pass 591/591
```

**Step 2: Execute Phases 1-7**

Open [MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md](./MIGRATION-PROMPTS.md) and execute each prompt in sequence:

1. **PROMPT 1** - Impact Analysis (read-only, no changes)
2. **PROMPT 2** - Create mapping layer
3. **PROMPT 3** - Update UI components
4. **PROMPT 4** - Update marketing pages
5. **PROMPT 5** - Create referrer form
6. **PROMPT 6** - Hide founder application
7. **PROMPT 7** - Update tests

After **EACH** prompt:
```bash
git diff                  # Review changes
npm run type-check        # Check TypeScript
npm test                  # Run tests
npm run dev               # Manual testing
git commit -m "feat: ..." # Commit changes
```

**Step 3: Validation**

After Phase 7:
- [ ] All 591+ tests passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Manual QA complete
- [ ] Stakeholder review
- [ ] Ready for deployment

**Step 4: Deploy & Monitor**

Deploy to production and monitor for 3+ months before considering Phase 6 (database migration).

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Protocols

### What Makes This Safe?

1. **Read-Only Phase 1** - Analyze before changing anything
2. **Display Layer Pattern** - Don't touch database initially
3. **Incremental Commits** - Easy to rollback any step
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Tests updated at each phase
5. **Manual Validation** - Human checks after each phase
6. **Feature Flags** - Enable/disable features without code changes
7. **Phase 6 Optional** - Database changes are future/optional

### Emergency Rollback

**If anything breaks:**

```bash
# Quick rollback - revert last commit
git revert HEAD

# Full rollback - return to start
git reset --hard origin/main

# Surgical rollback - go back N commits
git log --oneline       # Find commit hash
git reset --hard <hash>
```

### When to Rollback

**Rollback immediately if:**
- Authentication stops working
- Users can't access accounts
- Payment processing fails
- More than 5 test failures
- Critical functionality breaks

**Consider rollback if:**
- User complaints spike
- Performance degrades significantly
- Support tickets increase 50%+

- Allows UI changes without database risk
- Used by many large-scale applications
- Enables gradual migrations

**Feature Flags:**
- Toggle features on/off without code changes
- Enable testing in production
- Easy rollback mechanism
- Industry standard practice

**Controlled Migration:**
- Small, reversible steps
- Validate at each step
- Monitor and measure
- Rollback plan ready

## ü§î FAQ

### Q: Why not just change the database values directly?

**A:** Changing database values requires:
- Updating all RLS policies
- Modifying authentication logic
- Changing all enum types
- Updating all migrations
- High risk of breaking auth/payments
- Difficult to rollback

The display layer approach is safer and reversible.

---

### Q: When should we run Phase 6 (database migration)?

**A:** Only after:
- 3+ months of stable UI changes
- Zero role-related bugs reported
- All stakeholders approve
- Full database backup created
- Migration tested in staging

Phase 6 is **optional** - you may never need it if the display layer works well.

---

### Q: What if we find issues after deployment?

**A:** This is why we:
- Deploy incrementally (one phase at a time)
- Keep feature flags (instant off switch)
- Maintain comprehensive tests
- Document rollback procedures
- Monitor metrics closely

You can rollback any phase immediately with `git revert`.

---

### Q: How long will this really take?

**A:** Time breakdown:
- **Planning/Review:** 1-2 hours
- **Phase 1:** 2-3 hours (analysis + mapping layer)
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 hours (UI updates)
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 hours (marketing content)
- **Phase 4:** 4-5 hours (forms)
- **Phase 5:** 2-3 hours (tests)
- **Testing/QA:** 2-3 hours
- **Total:** 16-23 hours

Spread across 1-2 weeks for careful execution and testing between phases.

---

### Q: Can we do this in production?

**A:** **No.** Follow this sequence:

1. **Development:** Complete Phases 1-7
2. **Testing:** Full QA in dev environment
3. **Staging:** Deploy and test (if you have staging)
4. **Production:** Deploy with monitoring
5. **Monitor:** Watch for issues for 1-2 weeks
6. **Phase 6:** Only after 3+ months production stability

---

### Q: What if our team is not comfortable with this?

**A:** Completely valid concern. Options:

1. **Start smaller:** Just do Phase 1-2 (mapping layer only)
2. **Get expert help:** Hire a consultant to guide
3. **Defer decision:** Wait until team has more capacity
4. **Alternative approach:** Update only marketing content first

This migration is **not urgent** unless business requires it.
