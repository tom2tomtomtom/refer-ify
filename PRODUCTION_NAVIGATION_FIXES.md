**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ ALL FIXES APPLIED  
**Impact:** Homepage and navigation now fully functional in production

## 🚨 PROBLEMS FOUND IN PRODUCTION

### Issue #1: No "Sign In" Link for Anonymous Users
**Problem:** Anonymous users had no way to sign in from the header navigation  
**Impact:** Users couldn't access login page  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Solutions Sidebar Links Broken  
**Problem:** All 3 solution buttons linked to auth-protected routes  
- "Get Started" → `/founding-circle` ❌ (requires auth)
- "Join Select Circle" → `/select-circle` ❌ (requires auth)
- "Explore Solutions" → `/client` ❌ (requires auth)
**Impact:** All buttons returned 404 or redirect  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Issue #3: Homepage CTAs Wrong
**Problem:** Main call-to-action buttons linked to wrong pages  
- "Request Invitation" → `/login` (not helpful)
- "Explore Client Solutions" → `/client` ❌ (requires auth)
**Impact:** Poor user experience, broken navigation  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## ✅ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Added "Sign In" Link to Header
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Sign Out only shown if logged in
{(normalizedRole !== null || process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') && (
  <SignOutButton />
)}

// AFTER: Show "Sign In" for anonymous, "Sign Out" for logged in
{normalizedRole !== null ? (
  <SignOutButton />
) : (
  <Link href="/login" className="hover:text-foreground font-medium">Sign In</Link>
)}
```

**Result:** Anonymous users now see "Sign In" in header navigation

---

### Fix #2: Updated Solutions Sidebar Links
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/home/SolutionsSidebar.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Founding Circle:
href: "/founding-circle" → "/join-network" ✅

// Select Circle:
href: "/select-circle" → "/join-network" ✅

// Client Solutions:
href: "/client" → "/for-companies" ✅
```

**Result:** All solutions buttons now go to public marketing pages

---

### Fix #3: Updated Homepage CTA Buttons
**File:** `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
```typescript
// "Request Invitation" button:
href="/login" → "/join-network" ✅

// "Explore Client Solutions" button:
href="/client" → "/for-companies" ✅
```

**Result:** Homepage buttons now lead to correct public pages
