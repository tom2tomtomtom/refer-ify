## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Tests Fail

1. **Don't panic** - Review the error messages
2. **Identify cause** - Which tests failed and why?
3. **Options:**
   - Fix the issue if it's a simple fix
   - Rollback changes: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
   - Ask for help if needed

### If TypeScript Errors Occur

1. **Read the error** - TypeScript errors are usually informative
2. **Check recent changes** - What files were just modified?
3. **Options:**
   - Fix type mismatches
   - Add proper types
   - Rollback: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`

### If Development Server Won't Start

1. **Check terminal output** - Look for error messages
2. **Common causes:**
   - Syntax errors in code
   - Missing dependencies
   - Port already in use
3. **Quick fixes:**
   ```bash
   # Kill process on port
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill

   # Reinstall dependencies
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install

   # Rollback changes
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

### If Database Issues Occur

1. **STOP immediately** - Don't make more changes
2. **Check database backup** - Ensure backup exists
3. **Review migration** - Was it applied correctly?
4. **Rollback options:**
   - Revert migration in Supabase dashboard
   - Restore from backup
   - Contact database admin

### Emergency Rollback

**If anything breaks critically:**

```bash
# Option 1: Revert last commit
git revert HEAD
git push origin feature/terminology-migration

# Option 2: Hard reset (use with caution)
git log --oneline
# Find last good commit hash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push --force origin feature/terminology-migration

# Option 3: Abandon feature branch
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/terminology-migration
# Restart from clean state
```
