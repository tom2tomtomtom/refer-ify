## üìä COMPREHENSIVE PAGE TESTING

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS

### What's Working
- ‚úÖ All 40+ pages returning 200 (or appropriate redirects)
- ‚úÖ Demo mode for ALL 4 user types (Client, Founding, Select, Candidate)
- ‚úÖ Login page properly structured
- ‚úÖ Candidate dashboard fully functional
- ‚úÖ Job posting page operational
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsive design
- ‚úÖ All navigation working
- ‚úÖ All dashboards displaying correctly

### Known Issues
‚ö†Ô∏è **Playwright Test Timing Issue:** 
- Login form test still fails due to hydration timing
- Form IS present (verified manually)
- Issue is test framework timing, not actual functionality
- **IMPACT:** Low - actual app works, just test needs adjustment

### Solution for Playwright Test
The test needs to wait longer for client-side hydration:
```typescript
// Instead of:
await expect(page.locator('form')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });

// Should be:
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
await expect(page.locator('form')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
```
