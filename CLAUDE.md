4. **UI Components**: All core UI components with accessibility testing
5. **Business Components**: Job management, referral systems, dashboard components
6. **Integration Flows**: End-to-end user workflows and business processes

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage     # Full coverage report
npm test -- --watch        # Development mode
npm run test:integration    # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e           # End-to-end tests only
```

### Test File Organization
- **Component Tests**: `src/__tests__/components/` - Unit tests for React components
- **API Tests**: `src/__tests__/api/` - API route and endpoint testing  
- **Integration Tests**: `src/__tests__/integration/` - Cross-system workflow testing
- **Utility Tests**: `src/__tests__/lib/` - Helper function and utility testing
- **E2E Tests**: `e2e/` - Playwright end-to-end browser testing

## Business Model & Architecture

### Multi-Role System
- **Founding Circle**: Platform owners (full access)
- **Select Circle**: Premium referrers (priority access)
- **Client**: Companies posting jobs (job management)
- **Candidate**: Job seekers (limited dashboard access)

### Subscription Tiers
- **Connect**: $500/month - Basic job posting
- **Priority**: $1500/month - Enhanced visibility
- **Exclusive**: $3000/month - Full network access

### Database Schema (Key Tables)
- `users` - User authentication and profiles
- `jobs` - Job postings with subscription tiers
- `referrals` - Referral submissions and tracking
- `candidates` - Professional profiles and resumes
- `candidate_referrals` - Referral relationship tracking
- `payment_transactions` - Stripe payment tracking and history
- `subscriptions` - Client subscription management
- `revenue_distributions` - Automated fee distribution (45%/40%/15%)
- `ai_match_analysis` - AI-powered candidate matching scores
- `ai_referral_suggestions` - AI-generated referral recommendations

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server (port 3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript validation
npm test             # Run test suite
