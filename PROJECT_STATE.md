## Known Errors & Solutions
- ✅ **LinkedIn OAuth redirect_uri mismatch**: Fixed by updating redirect URLs in both LinkedIn app and Supabase
- ✅ **Magic link auth not persisting session**: Resolved with proper server-side cookie handling
- ✅ **Next.js 15 + Supabase SSR compatibility**: Fixed with proper cookie management in server client
- ✅ **TypeScript lint errors**: Resolved Stripe API version and empty object types
- ✅ **Next.js 15 route parameter types**: Fixed async params for dynamic routes
- ✅ **Supabase order query syntax**: Fixed nullsFirst vs nullsLast parameter
- ⚠️ **Next.js 15 cookies() async warning**: Server shows warnings but app functions correctly (non-breaking)
