# Refer-ify Terminology Migration Plan

**Project Type:** Strategic Controlled Terminology Migration
**Risk Level:** Medium (UI changes) to High (Database changes)
**Estimated Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Reversibility:** High (each phase is independently reversible)

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document outlines a systematic, phase-based approach to migrating Refer-ify's role terminology from:
- **"Founding Circle"** ‚Üí **"Founder"** (as a role/member type)
- **"Select Circle"** ‚Üí **"Referrer"** or **"Member"**
- **"Client"** and **"Candidate"** remain unchanged

The migration uses a **display layer pattern** to decouple user-facing terminology from database schema, ensuring backwards compatibility and safe, reversible changes.

---

## üéØ Strategic Approach

### Why Display Layer Pattern?

1. **Zero Database Risk**: Keep existing enum values, RLS policies, and migrations intact
2. **Instant Rollback**: Revert UI changes without touching data
3. **Gradual Migration**: Update components independently at your own pace
4. **Testing Safety**: Test display changes without risking data integrity
5. **Future Flexibility**: Easy to change terminology again if needed

---

## üìä Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Terminology Migration (Safe, Reversible)
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Reversibility:** HIGH

- Analyze impact across codebase
- Create role display mapping layer
- Update UI components to use mapping layer
- **No database changes**

### Phase 2: Application Form Changes (Moderate Risk)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM
**Reversibility:** HIGH

- Create new referrer application form
- Hide founder application (feature flag approach)
- Add new database tables for referrer applications
- Update marketing CTAs

### Phase 3: Content Updates (Marketing Copy)
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Reversibility:** HIGH

- Update pricing page with new flat-fee model
- Update marketing pages with CEO-provided content
- Add FAQ section
- Create/update story page

### Phase 4: Validation & Testing
**Risk Level:** LOW
**Reversibility:** N/A

- Update test suite for new terminology
- Run comprehensive QA
- Performance testing
- User acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Database Migration (Optional, Future)
**Risk Level:** HIGH
**Reversibility:** MEDIUM

- **Execute ONLY after months of successful UI changes**
- Add display_role column (non-breaking)
- Create bridge migration for gradual transition
- **Do NOT remove old role column yet**

---

## üîç PHASE 1: IMPACT ANALYSIS

### Prompt 1: Analyze Impact Scope

**Objective:** Understand the full scope of changes before touching any code.

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
Analyze the Refer-ify codebase and provide a comprehensive impact report for the following terminology changes:

OLD ‚Üí NEW TERMINOLOGY:
- "Founding Circle" ‚Üí "Founder" (as a role/member type)
- "Select Circle" ‚Üí "Referrer" or "Member"
- Keep "Client" and "Candidate" unchanged

Search for all occurrences in:
1. Database schema files (supabase/migrations/*.sql)
2. TypeScript types and interfaces (src/types/*)
3. React components (src/components/**/*)
4. API routes (src/app/api/**/*)
5. Test files (src/__tests__/**/*)
6. Marketing pages (src/app/(marketing)/**/*)
7. Configuration files

For each file found, report:
- File path
- Number of occurrences
- Context (enum values, hardcoded strings, UI labels, comments)
- Risk level (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on whether it affects:
  * Database schemas/migrations (HIGH)
  * Authentication/RLS policies (HIGH)
  * Payment logic (HIGH)
  * UI labels only (LOW)
  * Test assertions (MEDIUM)

DO NOT make any changes yet. Just provide the impact analysis report.
```

**Expected Output:**
- Comprehensive file list with occurrence counts
- Risk assessment for each file
- Identification of high-risk areas (database, auth, payments)
- Recommendations for execution order

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All file types searched
- [ ] Risk levels assigned
- [ ] No changes made yet
- [ ] Report saved for reference

## üõ†Ô∏è PHASE 2: CREATE DISPLAY MAPPING LAYER

### Prompt 2: Create Role Display Mapping Layer

**Objective:** Create abstraction layer to decouple display terminology from database values.

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
I need to implement a terminology mapping layer without breaking existing database logic.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a new utility file: src/lib/role-display.ts
2. Implement these functions:
   - getRoleDisplay(dbRole: string): string
   - getRoleFromDisplay(displayRole: string): string
   - ROLE_DISPLAY_MAP constant

MAPPING RULES:
- Database role "founding_circle" ‚Üí Display as "Founder"
- Database role "select_circle" ‚Üí Display as "Referrer"
- Database role "client" ‚Üí Display as "Client" (unchanged)
- Database role "candidate" ‚Üí Display as "Candidate" (unchanged)

3. Add TypeScript types:
   - DatabaseRole type (union of existing enum values)
   - DisplayRole type (union of new display strings)

4. Include JSDoc comments explaining:
   - Why we keep old database values (backwards compatibility)
   - When to use display vs database roles
   - Migration plan for future

5. Export a ROLE_LABELS constant for UI dropdowns/badges

EXAMPLE USAGE PATTERN:
```typescript
// In components
const displayRole = getRoleDisplay(user.role); // "Founder" instead of "founding_circle"

// In API calls
const dbRole = getRoleFromDisplay("Founder"); // "founding_circle" for database
```

Create this utility with full TypeScript safety and comprehensive error handling.
```

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add unit tests immediately
- Include error handling for unknown roles
- Add deprecation warnings if needed
- Document in code comments

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] File created: src/lib/role-display.ts
- [ ] All functions implemented
- [ ] TypeScript types defined
- [ ] JSDoc comments added
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] No TypeScript errors

---

## üé® PHASE 3: UPDATE UI COMPONENTS

### Prompt 3: Update UI Components with Display Layer

**Objective:** Systematically update all React components to use the new role display mapping.

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
Update all React components to use the new role display mapping layer.

SCOPE: src/components/**/*.tsx

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Import the role display utilities:
   import { getRoleDisplay, ROLE_LABELS } from '@/lib/role-display'

2. Replace hardcoded role strings with mapped values:
   BEFORE: {user.role === 'founding_circle' && 'Founding Circle'}
   AFTER: {getRoleDisplay(user.role)}

3. Update role badges/labels to use ROLE_LABELS constant

4. Search for these patterns to replace:
   - "Founding Circle" (hardcoded strings)
   - "Select Circle" (hardcoded strings)
   - founding_circle (enum references in JSX)
   - select_circle (enum references in JSX)

5. DO NOT change:
   - Database queries or mutations
   - API route logic
   - RLS policy references
   - Type definitions that match database schema

6. Focus on these component directories:
   - src/components/dashboard/*
   - src/components/navigation/*
   - src/components/auth/*
   - src/components/jobs/*
   - src/components/referrals/*

7. Preserve all existing logic, only update display strings

VALIDATION:
- Run TypeScript compiler after changes
- Ensure no database queries are affected
- Test that role-based conditionals still work correctly

Show me each file you plan to modify before making changes.
```

**Component Update Strategy:**
1. Start with low-risk components (badges, labels)
2. Move to medium-risk (navigation, dashboard)
3. Finish with high-risk (auth flows, role checks)

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] All components updated
- [ ] No database logic changed
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] No runtime errors in dev environment
- [ ] Role-based conditionals still work

## üö´ PHASE 6: HIDE FOUNDER APPLICATION

### Prompt 6: Remove/Hide Founder Application

**Objective:** Hide founder application using feature flags for potential future use.

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
Hide or remove the "Apply to become a Founder" functionality from the site.

APPROACH: Instead of deleting, add a feature flag for potential future use.

TASKS:
1. Search for all references to "founder application" or "founding circle application"
2. Identify these locations:
   - Navigation links
   - Marketing page CTAs
   - Application form pages
   - Database tables (keep but mark deprecated)

3. Implement feature flag:
   - Add to environment variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FOUNDER_APPLICATIONS=false
   - Wrap founder application routes in conditional rendering
   - Update navigation to exclude founder application links

4. Add deprecation notice in code:
   ```typescript
   // DEPRECATED: Founder applications now invite-only
   // Keeping code for reference but hidden via feature flag
   // Remove after 6 months if not needed (date: [current date + 6 months])
   ```

5. Update any "Apply Now" CTAs on marketing pages to point to referrer application

DO NOT:
- Delete database migrations
- Remove existing founder application data
- Break links that might be bookmarked

Show me all locations found before making changes.
```

**Feature Flag Configuration:**
```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FOUNDER_APPLICATIONS=false
```

**Validation Checklist:**

   - Find tests checking for "Select Circle" text
   - Update expectations to "Referrer"

3. Update test fixtures/mocks:
   - Keep database role values in fixtures
   - Update expected display strings in assertions

4. Run full test suite and fix any failures

5. Update test documentation with note about role display layer

VALIDATION:
- All tests should pass
- Coverage should remain at 96.4% or higher
- No tests should directly check for old display strings

Show me test failures before fixing them so I can review the approach.
```

## üóÑÔ∏è PHASE 8: DATABASE MIGRATION (FUTURE)

### Prompt 8: Database Schema Migration

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Execute ONLY after all UI changes are tested and deployed for several months.**

**Objective:** Create non-breaking database migration to add display role column.

**Claude Code Prompt:**
```
CRITICAL: Only execute this after all UI and business logic changes are tested and deployed.

Create a non-breaking database migration to support new role terminology.

APPROACH: Additive changes only, no deletions or renames yet.

MIGRATION: supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_add_role_display_mapping.sql

```sql
-- Add display_role column (nullable initially for backwards compatibility)
alter table profiles
add column display_role text;

-- Populate display_role from existing role values
update profiles
set display_role = case
  when role = 'founding_circle' then 'Founder'
  when role = 'select_circle' then 'Referrer'
  when role = 'client' then 'Client'
  when role = 'candidate' then 'Candidate'
  else role
end;

-- Add check constraint for valid display roles
alter table profiles
add constraint valid_display_role
check (display_role in ('Founder', 'Referrer', 'Client', 'Candidate'));

-- Add index for display_role queries
create index idx_profiles_display_role on profiles(display_role);

-- Add comment explaining dual-role system
comment on column profiles.display_role is
'User-facing role name. Mapped from legacy role column for backwards compatibility. Eventually role column will be deprecated.';

-- Create view for easy querying with display names
create or replace view profiles_with_display as
select
  *,
  case
    when role = 'founding_circle' then 'Founder'
    when role = 'select_circle' then 'Referrer'
    else role
  end as computed_display_role
from profiles;
```

TESTING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Migration runs without errors on development database
- [ ] All existing profiles have display_role populated
- [ ] RLS policies still work correctly
- [ ] No queries broken by new column
- [ ] Can rollback migration if needed

DO NOT:
- Drop or rename existing role column
- Change enum values
- Modify RLS policies yet
- Force non-null constraint on display_role

This is a bridge migration. Future migration will complete the transition.
```

**Pre-Migration Requirements:**
1. All UI changes deployed and stable for 3+ months
2. No user-reported issues with role display
3. Full database backup created
4. Rollback plan documented
5. Staging environment tested
6. Stakeholder approval obtained

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Pre-migration requirements met
- [ ] Database backup created
- [ ] Migration tested in staging
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] RLS policies validated
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

## üö® RISK MITIGATION

### Identified Risks & Mitigation Strategies

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Breaking authentication flows | HIGH | Use display layer, don't touch auth logic |
| RLS policies stop working | HIGH | Don't modify database roles or policies |
| Payment processing errors | HIGH | Keep all payment logic using database roles |
| Test suite failures | MEDIUM | Update tests incrementally, maintain coverage |
| User confusion from terminology change | LOW | Clear communication, staged rollout |
| SEO impact from URL changes | LOW | Keep URLs unchanged, update content only |
| Third-party integrations break | MEDIUM | Audit integrations, test webhooks |

### Rollback Triggers

**Immediately rollback if:**
- Authentication stops working
- Users cannot access their accounts
- Payment processing fails
- Critical functionality breaks
- Database corruption occurs
- More than 5 test failures

**Consider rollback if:**
- User complaints increase significantly
- Support tickets spike
- Performance degrades
- SEO rankings drop
