## Critical Performance Issues (Week 1 - Revenue Blocking)

### üö® Issue #1: Page Load Timeout Crisis
**Impact:** **SEVERE** - Pages consistently failing to reach stable state within 60 seconds
- **Symptom:** No pages achieve 'networkidle' state within 15+ seconds
- **Business Impact:** High bounce rate, poor SEO ranking, conversion loss
- **Root Cause:** Long-running scripts, persistent background requests, resource loading failures
- **Evidence:** 100% test timeout rate across homepage, auth pages, dashboard

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Performance Audit** - Lighthouse analysis of all critical pages
2. **Network Request Analysis** - Identify and eliminate persistent failing requests
3. **Script Optimization** - Defer non-critical JavaScript, implement lazy loading
4. **CDN Review** - Verify asset delivery optimization

**Success Metric:** Pages must achieve 'networkidle' within 5 seconds (industry standard)

### üö® Issue #2: Network Request Failures
**Impact:** **SEVERE** - Multiple 404 errors and aborted requests
- **Failing Routes:** `/apply?_rsc=3lb4g`, `/login?_rsc=3lb4g`
- **Error Pattern:** React Server Components requests failing consistently
- **Business Impact:** Authentication flow disruption, application functionality breakdown

**Root Causes Identified:**
- Missing route handlers for RSC requests
- Improperly configured Next.js app router
- Potential middleware conflicts

**Immediate Fixes:**
1. Audit and fix missing API routes
2. Verify Next.js 15 app router configuration
3. Review middleware.ts for request interference
4. Implement proper error boundaries

### üö® Issue #3: Console Error Cascade
**Impact:** **HIGH** - JavaScript errors preventing feature functionality
