# üéØ ACTION PLAN - CEO Walkthrough Preparation
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Objective:** Get MVP ready for CEO walkthrough and feedback session  
**Current Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 Critical Bugs Blocking Demo

---

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 2-4 Hours)

### Priority 0: Critical Bug Fixes

#### 1. Fix Login Page (30-45 min)
**File:** `/Users/thomasdowuona-hyde/refer-ify/apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Login form not rendering properly in tests
**Action:**
```bash
# Test manually first
open http://localhost:3000/login

# Check if form is visible
# If broken, investigate:
# - Component hydration
# - Form element structure
# - Add data-testid="login-form" to form element
```

**Fix:**
- Ensure `<form>` element exists with proper attributes
- Add `data-testid="login-form"` for testing
- Verify email and password inputs render
- Test in browser manually

---

#### 2. Fix/Remove Candidate Route (20-30 min)
**File:** Check if `/Users/thomasdowuona-hyde/refer-ify/apps/web/src/app/candidate/page.tsx` exists

**Issue:** `/candidate` route causes ERR_ABORTED
**Action:**
```bash
# Check if file exists
ls -la /Users/thomasdowuona-hyde/refer-ify/apps/web/src/app/candidate/

# Option A: Create if missing
# Option B: Remove from navigation if not needed for MVP
```

**Decision Required:** 
- Is candidate dashboard needed for CEO demo?
- If YES: Create minimal page
- If NO: Remove from navigation links

---

#### 3. Verify Job Posting Page (20-30 min)
**File:** `/Users/thomasdowuona-hyde/refer-ify/apps/web/src/app/client/jobs/new/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Page reported as not accessible
**Action:**
```bash
# Manual test
# 1. Switch to client role in demo mode
# 2. Navigate to /client/jobs/new
# 3. Verify form loads
# 4. Check console for errors
```

**If Broken:**
- Check JobPostingForm component imports
- Verify requireRole("client") works
- Check for runtime errors

---

### Priority 1: Manual Testing (30 min)

#### Test Critical Paths
```bash
# 1. Homepage
curl http://localhost:3000/ # Should return 200

# 2. Login page
curl http://localhost:3000/login # Should return 200

# 3. Demo mode workflow

# - Click "Demo as Client Company"
# - Verify redirect to /client
# - Check navigation works
# - Try all 3 demo roles

# 4. Marketing pages
# - Test /for-companies
# - Test /join-network
# - Test /how-it-works
```
