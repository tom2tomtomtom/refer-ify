4. Executive-grade UX standards required
5. Financial calculations must be 100% accurate

**Documentation References:**
- Quick rules: CONTEXT_ANCHORS.md
- Core context: .claude-suite/CLAUDE.md

## üé® Cursor Session Templates

### UI Development Session
```markdown
UI Development Session - Refer-ify Frontend:

**Platform Identity:**
- Executive recruitment through professional networks
- Premium, sophisticated, trustworthy experience
- Never job board - always referral-based introductions

**Design Standards:**
- Executive-grade professional aesthetics
- Clean, sophisticated, premium feel throughout
- Consistent Tailwind spacing and typography
- Shadcn/ui components with custom enhancements
- Mobile-first responsive design

**Current Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 4.x + Shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- Server Components default, Client Components marked
- Role-based conditional rendering

**Business Rules for UI:**
1. NO "Browse Jobs" or "Apply Now" interfaces for candidates
2. Role-based content visibility (Founding ‚Üí Select ‚Üí Client)
3. Professional terminology always (executives, not users)
4. Clear subscription tier value communication
5. Relationship-based referral language throughout

**Current Priorities:**
- Referral submission forms (high-priority UX work)
- Client referral management dashboards
- Real-time status update interfaces
- File upload components for resume handling

**Hand-off to Claude Code:**
Use when you need: API integration, database operations, 
business logic, authentication, or comprehensive testing

### Component Development Session
```markdown
Component Development Session - Refer-ify UI:

**Component Development Context:**
- Building for Refer-ify: referral-only executive recruitment
- Target users: Senior executives and hiring decision-makers
- Quality standard: Enterprise SaaS application level

**Technical Requirements:**
- TypeScript with strict typing (no any types)
- Functional components with React hooks
- Proper accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Error boundaries and graceful degradation
- Loading states for all async operations

**Business Context for Components:**
- Multi-role system: Founding/Select Circle, Clients, Candidates
- Subscription tiers: Connect ($500), Priority ($1500), Exclusive ($3000)
- All interactions must respect role-based permissions
- Professional language and executive-focused messaging

**Component Patterns:**
```typescript
// Always use proper TypeScript interfaces
interface ComponentProps {
  className?: string;
  // ... specific props
}

// Functional components with proper error handling
export function Component({ className, ...props }: ComponentProps) {
  // Implementation with loading/error states
}
```

**Current Component Priorities:**
1. ReferralSubmissionForm - Core business functionality
2. JobRequirementForm - Client job posting interface  
3. ReferralStatusDashboard - Client referral management
4. NetworkManagement - Founding Circle network tools

Reference: Existing components in src/components/ for patterns
