## Phase 1: Test Stabilization (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: AI Component Fixes
```bash
# Run AI-specific tests
npm test -- src/__tests__/api/ai/ --watch

# Focus areas:
# - Fix OpenAI mock responses in handlers.ts
# - Update AI API endpoint test assertions
# - Resolve GPT-4 integration test failures
# - Validate error handling scenarios
```

### Day 3-4: Component Integration
```bash  
# Run component integration tests
npm test -- src/__tests__/app/ --watch

# Focus areas:
# - Standardize Supabase mock patterns
# - Fix CandidatesPage query mock issues
# - Resolve JobDetailPage text assertion conflicts
# - Update form validation test expectations
```

### Day 5: E2E Test Stabilization
```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Focus areas:
# - Implement proper async wait strategies
# - Fix referral flow timeout issues
# - Resolve file upload validation tests
# - Validate payment flow consistency
```

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Week 2)

### Day 1-2: Production Environment
```bash
# Vercel production setup
vercel --prod

# Environment configuration:
# - Production environment variables
# - Database connection pooling
# - CDN and caching configuration
# - SSL and security headers
```

### Day 3-4: Monitoring and Security
```bash
# Security audit
npm audit --audit-level=high
npm run build # Verify production build

# Setup monitoring:
# - Application performance monitoring
# - Error tracking (Sentry)
# - Database performance monitoring
# - Payment transaction monitoring
```

### Day 5: Go-Live Preparation
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
npm run test:all
npm run build
npm run type-check

# Deployment pipeline testing
# Rollback procedure validation
# Smoke test automation
```

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Test Reliability
- [ ] Test pass rate ≥98%
- [ ] All AI integration tests passing
- [ ] Component integration stable
- [ ] E2E tests reliable

### Gate 2: Infrastructure Readiness  
- [ ] Production environment configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Performance validated

### Gate 3: Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Deployment pipeline tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures validated
- [ ] Smoke tests automated
- [ ] Team trained on operations

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Test failures indicate deeper issues** → Thorough root cause analysis
2. **Payment processing errors** → Extensive financial flow testing
3. **Performance degradation** → Load testing and optimization
4. **Security vulnerabilities** → Professional security audit

### Rollback Plan
1. **Immediate rollback capability** via Vercel deployments
2. **Database rollback** via Supabase point-in-time recovery
3. **Payment system isolation** to prevent financial impact
4. **Communication plan** for stakeholders and users

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Test pass rate: 96.4% → 98%+
- API response time: <500ms average
