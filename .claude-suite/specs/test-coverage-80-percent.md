```

### Test Quality Standards

#### 1. **Test Structure** (AAA Pattern)
```typescript
describe('Component/Function Name', () => {
  // Arrange
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test environment
  })
  
  // Act & Assert
  it('should describe expected behavior', () => {
    // Arrange: Set up test data
    // Act: Execute the function/interaction
    // Assert: Verify expected results
  })
})
```

#### 2. **Mock Strategy**
```typescript
// Comprehensive mocking approach
Mock External Dependencies:
- ✅ Supabase client (already implemented)
- ✅ Stripe API calls  
- ✅ File upload services
- ✅ WebSocket connections
- ✅ External API calls (OpenAI)

Don't Mock:
- ✅ Internal business logic
- ✅ Pure utility functions
- ✅ Component internal state
- ✅ React hooks (use real implementations)
```

#### 3. **Coverage Requirements by File Type**
```typescript
Coverage Targets:
- Critical business logic: 100%
- API routes: 85%+
- React components: 80%+  
- UI components: 70%+
- Utility functions: 95%+
- Integration tests: Key user flows 100%
```

### Testing Commands & Workflow

#### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start test development
npm run test:watch                    # Watch mode for rapid feedback

# Check coverage during development  
npm run test:coverage                 # Full coverage report

# Run specific test categories
npm test -- --testPathPattern=components  # Component tests only
npm test -- --testPathPattern=api         # API tests only  
npm test -- --testPathPattern=lib         # Utility tests only

# Integration & E2E testing
npm run test:e2e:ui                   # Playwright with UI
npm run test:all                      # Complete test suite
```

#### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Quality Gates (must pass)
npm run test:ci                       # All unit/integration tests
npm run test:e2e                      # E2E tests headless mode
npm run test:coverage -- --threshold 80  # Enforce 80% coverage

# Coverage reporting
npm run test:coverage -- --coverageReporters=text-lcov | coveralls
```
