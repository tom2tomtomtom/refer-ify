## 🎯 Purpose

### For Developers
- **Consistent Process**: Standardized workflows for feature development
- **Quality Gates**: Comprehensive checklists ensure professional standards
- **Context Preservation**: Key business logic and technical decisions documented
- **Error Prevention**: Systematic error handling patterns prevent issues

### For Claude Code Assistant
- **Rich Context**: Complete understanding of product vision and technical architecture
- **Business Logic**: Clear understanding of referral-based platform rules
- **Quality Standards**: Executive-grade expectations for all development work
- **Decision History**: Access to architectural decisions and their reasoning

## 🔄 Three-Layer Context System

### Layer 1: Immediate Context (CLAUDE.md)
- Current development status and priorities
- Tech stack and architecture overview
- User roles and business logic rules
- Development commands and environment setup

### Layer 2: Process Context (workflows/)
- Feature development workflow
- Code review standards and checklists
- Testing strategy and quality requirements
- Error handling patterns and recovery strategies

### Layer 3: Strategic Context (project/)
- Product mission and vision
- Long-term roadmap and milestones
- Technical architecture decisions
- Business model and success metrics

## 🚀 Usage Guidelines

### For New Features
1. Review `workflows/feature-development.md` for process
2. Check `project/roadmap.md` for context and priorities
3. Follow `validation-checklists.md` for quality standards
4. Apply `error-handling.md` patterns for robustness

### For Code Reviews
1. Use `workflows/code-review.md` checklist
2. Validate against business rules in `CLAUDE.md`
3. Ensure architectural consistency with `project/decisions.md`
4. Verify testing standards from `workflows/testing-strategy.md`

### For Troubleshooting
1. Reference `error-handling.md` for common patterns
2. Check `project/tech-stack.md` for architecture details
3. Review `project/decisions.md` for historical context
4. Use `validation-checklists.md` for systematic debugging

## 🎯 Key Principles

### Executive-Grade Quality
Every aspect of development must meet professional executive standards:
- **User Experience**: Polished, intuitive, professional interface
- **Reliability**: Bulletproof error handling and graceful degradation
- **Performance**: Fast, responsive, scalable architecture
- **Security**: Enterprise-level security and privacy protection

### Referral-Platform Integrity
All development must maintain the core referral-based model:
- **No Job Board Features**: Candidates never browse or self-apply
- **Relationship-Based**: All connections come from personal networks
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict subscription tier access control
- **Network Value**: Features that strengthen professional relationships

### Comprehensive Testing
Testing is not optional - it's critical for executive platform reliability:
- **Unit Tests**: 80-90% coverage for all new code
- **Integration Tests**: All API routes and business processes
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys and multi-role scenarios
- **Quality Gates**: No deployment without passing all tests

## 📊 Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers productive quickly with comprehensive context
- **Fewer Bugs**: Systematic workflows and checklists prevent issues
- **Consistent Quality**: Standardized processes ensure professional standards
- **Efficient Reviews**: Clear guidelines speed up code review process

### Code Quality
- **Architecture Consistency**: Decision records maintain architectural integrity
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling patterns prevent failures
- **Test Coverage**: Systematic testing strategy ensures reliability
- **Professional Standards**: Executive-grade quality maintained throughout

## 🔄 Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **Context Updates**: CLAUDE.md updated with current development status
- **Process Refinement**: Workflows updated based on team feedback
- **Decision Recording**: New architectural decisions added to decisions.md
- **Quality Evolution**: Checklists updated with new quality standards

### Version Control
- All Claude Suite files tracked in git for version history
- Changes reviewed and approved like any other code changes
- Regular synchronization with actual codebase state
- Documentation accuracy maintained through development cycles
