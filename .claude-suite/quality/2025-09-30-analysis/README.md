## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start Small, Stay Consistent

✅ **Do**: 30 minutes daily
❌ **Don't**: 6 hours once a month

Consistency beats intensity for quality improvements.

---

### 2. Test After Every Change

Always run tests:
```bash
npm test -- --passWithNoTests --watchAll=false
```

This catches issues early and prevents regressions.

---

### 3. Commit Frequently

One subtask = one commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove console statements from auth components"
```

Small commits are easier to review and revert.

---

### 4. Celebrate Wins

Completed a task? 🎉
- Check it off in @tasks.md
- Update @progress.md
- Share with your team
- Take a moment to appreciate progress

---

### 5. Don't Optimize Prematurely

Follow the priority order:
1. HIGH → Fix critical issues first
2. MEDIUM → Then improve structure
3. LOW → Only then optimize

---

### 6. Ask for Help

Stuck on a task? That's normal!

**Resources:**
- Review @analysis-report.md for context
- Check @~/.claude-suite/standards/ for guidance
- Ask Claude: "How do I fix [specific issue]?"
- Google: "[technology] best practices"

---

### 7. Track Your Time

Estimate vs. actual helps you improve:
- Task says 2 hours
- Actually took 3 hours
- Next time: estimate 3 hours
- Learn your velocity!

---

## 🚧 Common Challenges

### "I don't have time for this"

**Solution**: Start with quick-wins (1.5 hours total)
- Immediate impact
- Builds momentum
- Shows value

Then: 30 minutes daily is enough!

---

### "Where do I start?"

**Solution**: Follow this exact order:
1. Read @quick-wins.md (5 min)
2. Do Quick Win #1 (5 min)
3. Feel the success! 🎉
4. Continue to Quick Win #2

---

### "I'm stuck on a task"

**Solution**: Break it down further
- Each subtask too big?
- Make micro-tasks
- One file at a time
- One function at a time

---

### "Tests are failing"

**Solution**: Debug systematically
1. Read the error message
2. Locate failing test
3. Understand what it tests
4. Check your changes
5. Fix or update test
6. Ask Claude if stuck

---

### "Health score not improving"

**Solution**:
- Are you checking off completed tasks?
- Are you following HIGH priority?
- Run `/monitor-quality` to check
- Review @progress.md metrics
