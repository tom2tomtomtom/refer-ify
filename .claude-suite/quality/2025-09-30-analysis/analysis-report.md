  - Location: Primarily in Supabase types, API routes, and components
- ⚠️ **Console statements**: 94 instances in 41 files
  - Should be removed or replaced with proper logging
  - Can leak sensitive data in production
- ⚠️ **ESLint errors**: 11 empty interface violations
  - TypeScript interfaces with no members
  - Should use `type` keyword or add properties

---

### Technical Debt Score: **85/100** 🟢

Following @~/.claude-suite/standards/best-practices.md

**Excellent Debt Management:**
- ✅ Only 1 TODO/FIXME comment (outstanding!)
- ✅ Minimal ESLint suppressions (only 1 instance)
- ✅ No deprecated API usage detected
- ✅ Clean git history with descriptive commits

**Minor Improvements:**
- 🟡 Console statements need cleanup
- 🟡 Type safety can be strengthened

---

### Testing Score: **75/100** 🟡

**Current Coverage:**
- **Overall**: 27.42% statements, 24.86% branches
- **Test Files**: 70 test files
- **Test/Source Ratio**: 29% (70 tests / 241 source files)

**Well-Tested Areas:**
- ✅ Authentication: 94-97% coverage (excellent!)
- ✅ Login/Signup pages: 90%+ coverage
- ✅ Core business flows: Comprehensive integration tests

**Coverage Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Middleware: 0% coverage (28 lines untested)
- ⚠️ Error boundaries: 0% coverage
- ⚠️ API callbacks: 0% coverage
- ⚠️ Many components: < 30% coverage

**Recommendations:**

- Focus on: API routes, middleware, error handling
- Strategy: Add integration tests for critical user flows

---

### Security Score: **90/100** 🟢

**Strong Security Posture:**
- ✅ No exposed secrets detected
- ✅ Using Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)
- ✅ Proper environment variable usage
- ✅ JWT token-based authentication
- ✅ HTTPS enforced via Vercel

**Minor Concerns:**
- 🟡 Console statements might leak sensitive data
- 🟡 Error messages should be sanitized for production

---

### Performance Score: **80/100** 🟢

**Good Performance Characteristics:**
- ✅ Next.js 15 with optimized builds
- ✅ Image optimization via next/image
- ✅ Code splitting via dynamic imports
- ✅ Efficient Supabase queries

**Optimization Opportunities:**
- 🟡 Some large component files (> 300 lines)
- 🟡 Real-time subscriptions could use optimization
- 🟡 Bundle size monitoring recommended

## 🔍 Top Issues by Impact

### 1. **Strengthen Type Safety** 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**Location**: 65 files with `any` usage
**Impact**: Reduces TypeScript benefits, increases runtime errors
**Fix Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Details:**
- 164 instances of `any` type across codebase
- Primarily in:
  - Supabase database types (apps/web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts)
  - API route handlers (apps/web/src/app/api/)
  - Component props (various)

**Recommendation:**
Replace `any` with proper types:
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
const handleSubmit = (data: any) => { ... }

// ✅ Good
interface FormData { name: string; email: string; }
const handleSubmit = (data: FormData) => { ... }
```

**Reference**: @~/.claude-suite/standards/code-style.md#typescript

---

### 2. **Remove Console Statements** 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**Location**: 41 files with console.log/error/warn
**Impact**: Production noise, potential data leaks
**Fix Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)

**Details:**
- 94 console statements throughout codebase
- Found in: Components, API routes, utilities, error handlers

**Recommendation:**
- Replace with proper logging library (e.g., winston, pino)
- Or remove debugging statements entirely
- Keep only intentional error logging

**Quick Win**: Run `/clean-codebase --console-only`

**Reference**: @~/.claude-suite/standards/best-practices.md#logging

---

### 3. **Fix ESLint Errors** 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY

**Location**: 11 empty interface violations
**Impact**: Code quality, maintainability
**Fix Effort**: Low (30 minutes)

**Details:**
ESLint rule: `@typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type`
- Empty interfaces detected (lines 63, 64, 78, 79, 84, 85, 86, 105, 106, 135, 136)

**Recommendation:**
```typescript
// ❌ Bad
interface Props extends BaseProps {}

// ✅ Good - Option 1: Use type
type Props = BaseProps

// ✅ Good - Option 2: Add properties
interface Props extends BaseProps {
  // Future properties go here
}
```

---

### 4. **Increase Test Coverage** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Location**: Middleware, API routes, error boundaries
**Impact**: Risk of production bugs, harder refactoring
**Fix Effort**: Medium (3-5 days)

**Current**: 27.42% coverage
**Target**: 60% coverage (realistic for production app)
**Gap**: ~33% needs coverage

**Priority Areas:**
1. **Middleware (0% coverage)**: Authentication/routing logic
2. **API Routes (varies)**: Payment webhooks, AI endpoints
3. **Error Boundaries (0% coverage)**: Error handling
4. **Components (< 30%)**: Job forms, referral flows

**Reference**: @~/.claude-suite/standards/best-practices.md#testing

---

### 5. **Optimize Large Files** 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Location**: Several files > 300 lines
**Impact**: Harder to maintain and test
**Fix Effort**: Medium (2-3 days)

**Strategy:**
- Extract complex logic into hooks
- Split large components into smaller ones
- Create utility functions for repeated logic

---
