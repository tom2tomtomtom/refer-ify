## Health Metrics

### Code Quality (Score: 85/100) ⭐️

**Excellent overall structure with minor optimization opportunities**

- **Large Files**: 3 files > 400 lines (needs splitting)
- **Complex Components**: JobPostingForm (503 lines) - main concern
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **TypeScript Usage**: Excellent type safety throughout

**Files Requiring Attention:**
- `JobPostingForm.tsx` (503 lines) - Split into smaller components
- `ai/suggestions.test.ts` (522 lines) - Comprehensive but could be modularized  
- `RealTimeJobFeed.tsx` (442 lines) - Consider component extraction

### Technical Debt (Score: 95/100) 🚀

**Outstanding debt management - minimal accumulation**

- **TODOs/FIXMEs**: Only 1 found (excellent!)
- **Single TODO**: Referral modal implementation in RealTimeJobFeed
- **No Code Duplication**: No significant duplication detected
- **No Deprecated APIs**: All dependencies current

### Security (Score: 88/100) 🔒

**Strong security posture with modern best practices**

- **No Exposed Secrets**: Environment variables properly handled
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth + Row Level Security implemented
- **API Security**: Proper request validation in API routes
- **HTTPS Everywhere**: Secure communication protocols

**Security Strengths:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies in place
- JWT token management via Supabase
- Input validation and sanitization
- Stripe integration follows security best practices

### Testing (Score: 75/100) ✅

**Comprehensive testing strategy with room for improvement**

- **Test Files**: 58 test files for 115 source files (50% ratio)
- **Coverage Strategy**: Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- **Test Quality**: Well-structured with proper mocking
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright

**Testing Breakdown:**
- ✅ API Routes: Excellent coverage
- ✅ Components: Good coverage of critical paths
- ⚠️ Edge Cases: Could use more boundary condition tests
- ⚠️ Integration: Some complex workflows need E2E coverage

### Performance (Score: 80/100) ⚡️

**Good performance foundation with optimization opportunities**

- **Bundle Size**: Reasonable with code splitting
- **Database**: Proper indexing and RLS policies
- **Caching**: Basic caching implemented
- **Images**: Next.js Image optimization in use

## Top Issues by Impact

### 1. **Large Component Files** (Medium Priority)
- **Location**: JobPostingForm.tsx:503, RealTimeJobFeed.tsx:442
- **Impact**: Maintenance difficulty, slower development
- **Fix Effort**: Medium (2-4 hours per file)
- **Solution**: Extract sub-components, create custom hooks

### 2. **Missing E2E Test Coverage** (Medium Priority)  
- **Location**: AI matching workflow, payment flows
- **Impact**: Risk of regressions in critical business flows
- **Fix Effort**: High (1-2 days)
- **Solution**: Playwright tests for complete user journeys

### 3. **Component State Complexity** (Low Priority)
- **Location**: JobPostingForm.tsx state management
- **Impact**: Testing difficulty, potential bugs
- **Fix Effort**: Medium (4-6 hours)
- **Solution**: Extract custom hooks, reduce component responsibility

## Recommendations

Based on modern React and Next.js best practices:

### 🎯 **Immediate Actions** (This Week)
1. **Split JobPostingForm** into logical sub-components
2. **Add E2E tests** for AI matching workflow
