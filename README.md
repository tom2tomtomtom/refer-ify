# 🚀 Refer-ify Executive Recruitment Platform

Your AI-powered development system for building the "Network = Networth" platform that monetizes professional networks through executive recruitment.

## ✨ What We're Building

**Refer-ify** - An exclusive executive recruitment platform with:
- **Founding Circle**: Elite tech executives (invitation-only) who monetize their networks
- **Select Circle**: Quality referrers recruited by Founding Circle  
- **Client Companies**: Organizations paying for access to this exclusive network
- **REFERRAL-BASED SYSTEM**: Network members refer people they know personally (NOT a job board)
- **AI-Powered Matching**: GPT-4 candidate scoring and relationship analysis

## 🎯 Business Model
- **Subscription Tiers**: Connect ($500), Priority ($1,500), Exclusive ($3,000) monthly
- **Clients pay for access** to quality referrers in the network
- **Network members earn fees** for successful referrals (NOT job applications)
- **Fee Distribution**: Platform (45%), Select Circle (40%), Founding Circle (15%)
- **Target Markets**: APAC & EMEA tech executives
- **Timeline**: 12-week MVP to prove "Network = Networth"
- **Core Principle**: Warm professional introductions, not cold job applications
