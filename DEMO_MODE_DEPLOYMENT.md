# Demo Mode Deployment - CEO Walkthrough Ready

**Deployment Time**: September 30, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to Railway
**Commit**: 145067a

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
Demo mode was not working properly in production:
- Pages showed empty data (no candidates, referrals, revenue)
- Demo buttons didn't create proper authentication sessions
- Pages required real authentication to display content

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Demo Seed Data API (`/api/demo/seed`)
Created comprehensive seed data that populates:
- **3 Demo Candidates**: Alex Johnson, Emily Carter, David Kim
- **2 Demo Jobs**: Senior Full-Stack Engineer ($160k-$220k), Product Manager ($140k-$190k)
- **3 Demo Referrals**: Various statuses (submitted, reviewing, interviewing)
- **3 Demo Revenue Transactions**: $15,000, $12,000, $18,000

#### 2. Demo Authentication API (`/api/demo/auth`)
- Creates proper authentication sessions for demo users
- Sets consistent demo user IDs across the system
- Works in production environment

#### 3. Updated Login Page
When clicking a demo button:
1. Seeds demo data via `/api/demo/seed`
2. Creates auth session via `/api/demo/auth`
3. Redirects to appropriate role dashboard

#### 4. Demo User IDs (Consistent Across System)
```
Founding Circle: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
Select Circle:   00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002
Client Company:  00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003
Candidate:       00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004
```

## Pages Now Working

## Testing the Demo

### Step 1: Go to Login Page
```
https://[your-railway-domain]/login
```

### Step 2: Click Any Demo Button
- "Demo as Founding Circle"
- "Demo as Select Circle"
- "Demo as Client Company"
- "Demo as Candidate"

### Step 3: Explore Dashboard
Each role now has realistic demo data:
- Candidates to browse
- Referrals to review
- Revenue to track
- Jobs to view

## Technical Details

### Demo Data Seeding
All demo data uses UUID v4 format with leading zeros for easy identification:
- IDs starting with `00000000-...`: Demo users
- IDs starting with `10000000-...`: Demo candidates
- IDs starting with `20000000-...`: Demo jobs
- IDs starting with `30000000-...`: Demo referrals
- IDs starting with `40000000-...`: Demo revenue

### Authentication Flow
1. User clicks demo button on `/login`
2. Frontend calls `/api/demo/seed` (POST) - seeds data if needed
3. Frontend calls `/api/demo/auth` (POST) - creates session
4. Cookie `dev_role_override` is set with role
5. Cookie `demo_user_id` is set with user ID
6. User is redirected to role dashboard
7. All pages recognize demo authentication

### Production Safety
- Demo mode works in production (no database timeout issues)
- All demo data uses reserved UUID ranges
- Demo users can't interfere with real user data
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
